These templates are in support of Trident Sandbox's Generate Standalone app functionality.  
Standalone apps are intended when running off local filesystem... hosted/appcache environment can use Save slots.

For more information see docs folder.

The default template that comes with Trident Sandbox is :

Template_Default.tsbx	: Basically strips out all UI elements except the Output Tabs and removes unneeded code.

You can make your tweak the Template or add your own, perhaps to support adding additional libraries or styling.
